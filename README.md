# RIdELIN-project ðŸš—ðŸ‘«ðŸ‘«

## Description:

Ridelin is a carpooling platform designed to connect users who want to share rides, aiming to reduce commuting costs, lessen traffic congestion, and lower carbon emissions. The website enables users to create profiles, offer or request carpool rides, and view available options based on their location, travel times, and preferences.

### Key Features:

1. **User Profiles**: Users can create and manage profiles with personal details and carpool preferences.
2. **Rides Management**:Users can create or delete rides by specifying preferences such as the number of passengers, pick-up/drop-off locations, and travel times.
3. **Booking Management**: Users can select a ride, book it, update their booking details, or delete their booking if necessary.

## Repository Overview:

This repository contains the **Backend** for the carpooling project, which is built using **Express + MongoDB**. It powers the server-side operations, including user authentication, ride matching, and data management. The Backend handles all API requests, ensuring secure and efficient processing of user data, ride bookings, and profile management. It provides a robust foundation for seamless client-side interactions and supports the dynamic functionality of the carpooling platform.

- **Frontend (React)**: The Frontend repository (located at (https://github.com/Tangy-Stackers/Ridelin-server)) contains the UI components, routes, and logic that runs on the client-side, interacting with the backend API to fetch data and display it to users.

- **Backend (Express)**: This backend repository contains the server-side logic, database interactions, and API endpoints that power the features in the frontend.

## Instructions:

1. Clone the Repository using :git clone --respository--
2. Navigate into the project directory: cd ridelin
3. Install Dependencies: npm install
4. Set up Environment Variables: You will need to create a .env file in the root of your project directory to configure environment variables for the app. This is where you will store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and other necessary configuration.
   - To create the .env file:
      * In the project folder, create a new file named .env.
      * Add Environment Variables
        - **PORT**: Port on which your frontend will run
          PORT=5003
        - **TOKEN_SECRET**: Secret key used for JWT authentication (same as the backend secret)
          TOKEN_SECRET= carpool or newidea
        - **VITE_API_URL**: URL of the frontend application (allowed origin for CORS)
          ORIGIN="http://localhost:5178"
    - Save and close .env File:
5. Run the Application: npm run dev
